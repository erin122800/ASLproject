    <p class="subcat">Capital “D” Deaf and lowercase “D” deaf are two very different things. This website is here to education the public on the difference between the terms and also how to get involved with the Deaf community. Below you will find the distinctions between uppercase and lowercase Deaf. Feel free to check out the Events tab to take a look at some local community events!</p>

        <p>Lowercase “d” deaf people are ashamed of their deafness. They never use sign language, and often opt for oralism, the practice of lipreading and mimicking the movement of words in order to communicate. deaf people never associate themselves with the Deaf community. They never say they are deaf, but prefer terms such as “hearing impaired”, as they see this as a medical condition rather than an identifying characteristic.

    <p class="subcat">Capital “D” Deaf people are those who are Deaf and proud of it. They embrace the fact that they are Deaf and utilize sign language, and make the fact that they are Deaf a part of their identity. Deaf people are very involved in the Deaf community, and often go to different events. They do not see their deafness as a disability or something that holds them back, they accept what makes them different and do not think that Deaf people should be treated differently.
